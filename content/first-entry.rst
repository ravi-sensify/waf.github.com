Every two years or so, I decide that I should probably have a tech blog, even if it's just a place for me to post notes on languages and systems I'm experimenting with. 
I spent a weekend playing around with a couple of static site generators, and finally settled on Acrylamid_. Here are my notes on the blog systems I tried out.

.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:

  #!/usr/bin/env python
  print "Hello World!"

.. _Acrylamid: http://posativ.org/acrylamid/
.. _github pages: https://github.com/waf/waf.github.com
